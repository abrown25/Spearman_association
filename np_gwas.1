.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B np_gwas
.RB [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This software will perform genome-wide assocaition tests of quantitative phenotypes. The test of association can either be non-parametric (based on Spearman correlation test), or parametric (t-test). Permutation P values can be calculated, which can optionally account for multiple testing (either familywise-error rate or false discovery rate).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B --help
Display help information.
.TP
.B --version
Display version information.
.TP
.BI "--pheno, --p " CHAR
Phenotype file [last argument].
.TP
.BI "--geno, --g " CHAR
Genotype file [stdin].
.TP
.BI "--out, --o " CHAR
Output file [stdout].
.TP
.BI "--cov, --c " CHAR
Optional covariates file, if specified analysis will be performed on the residuals, after controlling for covariates with least squares regression.
.TP
.B --ttest
Runs a test of standard parametric correlation between genotype and phenotype.
.TP
.B --pheno-id, --pid
Phenotype IDs are in the first column, if genotype IDs are also present then we check for mismatches.
.TP
.B --geno-id, --gid
genotype IDs are in the first row, if phenotype IDs are also present then we check for mismatches.
.TP
.BI "--pheno-col, --pc " INT
column for phenotype values, default is 1 if phenotype IDs are not present, 2 otherwise.
.TP
.BI "--geno-skip, --gs " INT
column at which genotype values start, preceding columns are printed.
.TP
.BI "--perm " INT(,INT)
calculated permuted p values, one following number indicates the number of permutations, two comma separated numbers gives the number of permutations and the seed.
.TP
.B --pval
report permutation p values for each test (needs perm options to be specified).
.TP
.B --fwer
calculates the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) based on permutations, corrected P values in the last column.
.TP
.B --fdr
calculates the False Discovery Rate (FDR) based on permutations, corrected P values in the last column.
.TP
.B --nocheck
skip check of IDs when both genotype and phenotype IDs are present.
.TP
.B --match
the program will rearrange the phenotype data so that the genotype and phenotype IDs match. If individuals are present in the genotype file only, the analysis will be halted.

.SH FILE FORMATS
.HP
.SS INPUT FILE FORMATS
.TP
.B Phenotype
Tab or whitespace separated file with phenotype values in column specified by --pc, and optional subject IDs in column 1.
.TP
.B Genotype
Tab or whitespace separated file where each row corresponds to single SNP, optional header line can contain subject IDs, number of columns specified by --gs are copied to results file.
.HP
.SS OUTPUT FILE FORMAT
.TP
Output contains the first info columns from the genotype file, followed by spearman correlation, t statistic, p value columns. When permutations are analysed, the p value calculated by permutations is printed if the --pval flag is used. The p value calculated by permutations and then the p value adjusted for multiple testing is shown if --fwer or --fdr flag is used. If none of these flags are present, then p values calculated on permuted datasets are reported next.
