Perform non-parametric association tests, with rapid permutations.

Usage: spearman [options]:
Options:
    --help           : Display help file
    -pheno, -p       : phenotype file [default: last argument]
    -geno, -g        : genotype file [default stdin]
    -output, -o      : output file [default stdout]
    -pheno-id, -pid  : phenotype IDs are in the first column, if genotype IDs are also present then we check for mismatches
    -geno-id, -gid   : genotype IDs are in the first row, if phenotype IDs are also present then we check for mismatches
    -pheno-col, -pc  : column for phenotype values, default is 1 if phenotype IDs are not present, 2 otherwise
    -geno-skip, -gs  : column at which genotype values start, preceding columns are printed
    -perm            : calculated permuted p values, one following number indicates the number of permutations, two comma separated numbers gives the number of permutations and the seed
    -pval            : report permutation p values for each test (needs perm options to be specified)
    -fwer            : calculates Family Wise Error Rate based on permutations

Input file formats:
    phenotype        : Tab or whitespace separated file with phenotype values in column specified by -pc, and optional subject IDs in column 1
    genotype         : Tab or whitespace separated file where each row corresponds to single SNP, optional header line can contain subject IDs, number of columns specified by -gs are copied to results file

Output:
    Output contains the first info columns from the genotype file, followed by spearman correlation, t statistic, p value columns. When permutations are analysed, the p value calculated by permutations is printed if the -pval flag is used. The p value calculated by permutations and then the p value adjusted for multiple testing is shown if -fwer is used. If neither flag is present, then p values for calculated on permuted datasets are reported next.
