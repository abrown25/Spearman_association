Perform non-parametric association tests, with rapid permutations.

Usage: spearman [options]:
Options:
--help          : Display help file
-pheno, -p      : phenotype file [mandatory]
-geno, -g       : genotype file [default stdin]
-pheno-id, -pi  : phenotype IDs are in the first column, if genotype IDs are also present then we check for mismatches
-geno-id, -gi   : genotype IDs are in the first row, if phenotype IDs are also present then we check for mismatches
-pheno-col, -pc : column for phenotype values, default is 1 if phenotype IDs are not present, 2 otherwise
-geno-skip, -gs : column at which genotype values start, preceding columns are printed
-perm           : calculated permuted p values, one following number indicates the number of permutations, two comma separated numbers gives the number of permutations and the seed

Input file formats:
phenotype       : Tab or whitespace separated file with phenotype values in column specified by -pc, and optional subject IDs in column 1
genotype        : Tab or whitespace separated file where each row corresponds to single SNP, optional header line can contain subject IDs, number of columns specified by -gs are copied to results file
Output:
Output is sent to the stdout, contains the first info columns from the genotype file, followed by spearman correlation, t statistic, p value columns and then a p value column for every calculated permutation of the data
